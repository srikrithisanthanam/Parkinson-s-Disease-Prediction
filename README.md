# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction
A Machine Learning Approach for the Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease via Speech Analysis
<br>
<b>Introduction</b>
<br>
Parkinson's Disease ranks as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's, affecting over 10 million people worldwide. It primarily manifests through the decline of motor and cognitive functions. Diagnosing Parkinson's is challenging due to the absence of a single definitive test; instead, physicians must conduct a thorough clinical evaluation of the patient's medical history. This method, however, is often unreliable. A study by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders indicates that the accuracy of early diagnosis (within the first five years of symptom onset) is only 53%, which is barely better than random guessing. Yet, early diagnosis is vital for effective treatment.<br>

<b>Dataset Used</b><br>
Given these diagnostic difficulties, I am exploring a machine learning approach to enhance the accuracy of Parkinson's diagnosis, using a dataset of various speech features provided by the University of Oxford. Speech features are highly indicative of Parkinson's disease because nearly every patient with Parkinson's experiences significant vocal degradation, such as difficulties with sustained phonation, tremors, and hoarseness. Thus, using voice analysis for diagnosis is logical. Additionally, this method is non-invasive, inexpensive, and easy to perform in clinical settings.<br>
